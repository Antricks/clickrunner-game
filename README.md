# ClickRunner

ClickRunner is a mobile game I made when I started working with Java and Android Studio. I'm not too proud of it, but it does have nostalic value for me ^^

You can play it with two players on one device. Whoever clicks faster on their side also runs faster to win the battle. I initially wanted to implement a mode where you just play against your own highscore too,  but I abandoned the project before I implemented that feature. You can  get it on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mofagames.game.remake.clickrunner) if you want.
